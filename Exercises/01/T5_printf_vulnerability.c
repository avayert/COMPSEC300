/*
 * T5_printf_vulnerability
 *
 * The printf vulnerability in this program can be
 * triggered by having a string such as "%d%s" as
 * your argv[1]. This gives printf a format specifier
 * and it will try to format these with arbitrary memory.
 *
 * This vulnerability could be used to print values that
 * the user is not supposed to see, such as cryptographic keys.
